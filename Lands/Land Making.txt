How to make a land!

Well this should be long XD
Ok here we go.....

Things you will need to know

Press "Shift + F1" and a bubble should come up. 
It tells you your exact position! You will need this
it will make your land a lot easier and faster to make.

Position
Here are what the numbers should mean.....

up.setPos(left and right,back and forward,height)

ya you just put in the numbers that were in the bubble when you pressed shift + f1
  
Here is a basic hackland with just a paint mixer

from direct.actor.Actor import Actor 
from pandac.PandaModules import * 
from direct.task import Task 
import math 
from math import pi, sin, cos 
from direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase 
from direct.task import Task 
from direct.interval.IntervalGlobal import Sequence 
from pandac.PandaModules import Point3 
from pandac.PandaModules import * 
from direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText 

up = loader.loadModel("phase_9/models/cogHQ/PaintMixer.bam") 
up.reparentTo(render) 
up.setPos(36,57.688,5.9) 
up.setHpr(0,0,0) 
up.setScale(1)

Now the things will not go away! DO NOT THINK IT SAVES 
IF YOU JUST KEEP CHANGING THE POSITION!!!!!!!!!!!!
So everytime u press submit u make new ones so
close out toontown with the "X" every sometime.

Now you can just keep doing that with different things in the phase files! That
easy!

make sure the slashes are like this

Right = /
Wrong = \
