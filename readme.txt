Toontown - Team FD Python Injector

PythonInjector.dll, TTDLLInjector.exe and readme.txt all belong were all created and credited to Team FD. This is a full-on Toontown Hack, and will be considered a bannable offence for the use of third party software. No what you are getting into before using this hack.
Team FD is not responsible for your actions. Use at your own risk. If you get any of your accounts banned during or after the use of this hack, please do not complain to anyone in the team. Thank you, enjoy, and goodluck yet again Disney!

Note to Toontown Administrators - You have patched inject.dll, but neglected to fix my various exploits/complaints. This is the result of outdated games. There is much you can do with this game if you update it constantly. Sure, you can ignore the hacks for about a week or two, but don't do it forever like with the first injector. Let's see how long this takes.
