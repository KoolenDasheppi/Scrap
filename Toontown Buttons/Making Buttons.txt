Making Buttons

Well here is a one button code

from direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText
from direct.gui.DirectGui import *
from pandac.PandaModules import TextNode

def setText1():
    base.localAvatar.collisionsOff()

b = DirectButton(text = ("Col Off", "CO", "CO", "Col Off"), scale=.06, pos = (-.75,-0,-.94), command=setText1)

Copy and paste that into the injector and press the button when it pops up!
when you press it your collisions should be off.

Now just copy and paste it example:

from direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText
from direct.gui.DirectGui import *
from pandac.PandaModules import TextNode

def setText1():
    base.localAvatar.collisionsOff()

def setText2():
    base.localAvatar.collisionsOn()

b1 = DirectButton(text = ("Col Off", "CO", "CO", "Col Off"), scale=.06, pos = (-.75,-0,-.94), command=setText1)
b2 = DirectButton(text = ("Col On", "CO", "CO", "Col On"), scale=.06, pos = (-.75,-0,-.84), command=setText2)

Just keep doing the pattern

here is the position

(-.left and right,i have no idea just keep it the same,-.height)
